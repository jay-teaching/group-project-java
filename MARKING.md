# Java

Excellent work selecting new features and re-training the model.
Well done extending what was taught in class to utilise some
additional features of Streamlit, including a helpful sidebar.
Good Docker CI pipeline to containerise two separate aspects of
the project.

Great commit history showing a mostly balanced distribution of
efforts in preparing the repository. Excellent work enhancing the
training notebook with interactivity and visualisations. Successful
at building an API with FastAPI and using continuous integration to
package it to Docker alongside the frontend container. Well done
preparing project documentation and having it deployed automatically
with GitHub Actions - consider separate pages for the docs instead of
a long single page. Great job at getting your excellent project
deployed to the cloud!
